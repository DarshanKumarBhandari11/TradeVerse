## Testing üß™
TradeVerse incorporates unit testing using Jest and React Testing Library to ensure code reliability and maintainability.

* **Unit Tests:**
    * Comprehensive unit tests are written for key components, such as the `Hero` component within the landing page, to verify their functionality.
    * Testing ensures that components render correctly, handle user interactions as expected, and maintain consistency across different scenarios.

* **Testing Libraries:**
    * **Jest:** A JavaScript testing framework used for writing and running unit tests.
    * **React Testing Library:** A library that provides utilities for testing React components by focusing on user behavior rather than implementation details.
    * **@testing-library/jest-dom:** Extends Jest with custom matchers for asserting on DOM nodes, making tests more expressive and readable.
    * **@testing-library/react:** Provides utilities for rendering and interacting with React components in a testing environment.
    * **@testing-library/user-event:** Simulates user interactions such as clicks, typing, and other events.

Example test snippet:
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import "@testing-library/jest-dom/extend-expect";
import Hero from "../landing_page/pricing/Hero";

describe('Hero Component', () => {
    test('renders hero image', () => {
        render(<Hero />);
        const heroImage = screen.getByAltText("intradayTradesImg");
        expect(heroImage).toBeInTheDocument();
        expect(heroImage).toHaveAttribute('src', 'media/images/intradayTrades.svg');
    });
});
